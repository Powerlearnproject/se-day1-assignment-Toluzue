Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enginnering involves using engineering tools and methods to create software system and programmes.
The importance of is in the creation of software programmes and models that is needed in the day to day running of the society in terms of allowing easy aceess to commerce, communication, transportation and majorly providing solutions to the major problems in different sectors in the country.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering the Machine (1956–1967)
The term software engineering had not yet been coined. Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were defined; operating systems were noninteractive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging. The lack of software development methods led to high risk and the origin of a new stage is easily noticeable.
Most software systems created in this stage are called management information systems. They were designed to be an important part of business management in large companies. This has led to a need for the methodologies to be adapted by increasing the abstraction levels in software engineering tasks up to the abstraction level in which the problem is described.
Mastering the Market (2011–…)
Now, there are new platforms for integration and interoperability between different information systems. The concept of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) coined in the early decade is widely extended. It is based on the combination of basic services (own or outside) that provide the functionality at business level for a specific domain problem. These services are orchestrated to perform more complex tasks, becoming composite services. These ubiquitous real-time services can be sold as a product, which is the origin of Cloud computing. On the other hand, customers demand several applications to be used in their smartphones, tablets, or laptops. 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Product Design: This involve creating design of a particular product whether web page, e-commerce page that will display the product to be purchased by the customer in digital pages.
Product Development: This involve the creation of codes that runs through the display of the product on web pages for the customers. It could be in a mobile app,desktop website or android app.
Product Testing: These are process and standard that are put in place for the usage of the product to carry out its function and to satisfy the customer needs in ourchasing such product
Product deployment: This is the release of the mobile app to the customers at large.
Maintenance: This is the mechansim in ensuring adequate maintenance is done through updation go some of the back end and front end programme to ensure the smooth running of the system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
A healthy waterfall environment doesn’t employ a “throw it over the wall” mindset where stakeholders pass on responsibility to the owner of the next phase. It is, however, primarily a linear process beginning with requirements and terminating in a final release or completion of the project.
In an Agile environment, you are divvying up work into Sprints, which are time-based bursts of activity, typically one-to-four weeks in length. This cadence dictates how much work is completed during a given period.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 The developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer. 
 QA engineers monitor every phase of the software development process, including development, testing, debugging and delivery. They ensure that quality is maintained at every stage of the development process and that the final product meets the requirements.
 In software development, the roles of the project manager may include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Version control systems have become an integral part of software development workflows due to their ability to tackle several critical challenges faced by developers. By providing a centralized repository, these systems enable better code management, collaboration, and accountability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A lot of development teams suffer because of a vague understanding of the engineering processes within their organization. Many don’t have clarity about the status of the projects, the activities and challenges of the individuals, and what not. 
If you’ve spent enough time in the software industry, you would know that it’s unpredictable. The requirements may change resulting in scope creep and an exponential increase in the project budget, a sudden storm of APIs & third-party library updates can easily morph into dependency hell and bring the entire cadence to a standstill (especially when external libraries get deprecated), bugs can multiply at the rate you see zombies multiply in movies and infest your code to completely mess up the customer experience, and an invisible technical debt until yesterday could be threatening you to blow your digital infrastructure to bits if you ignore it. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality. Automating unit tests is possible and highly recommended in today’s fast-paced development environment. To make a unit test, you should outline what you expect the code to do and write the code, which will check if it is doing what you expect. You should then run the unit test to verify that everything works as expected. For example, let’s say you have a calculator program that adds two numbers together. You can create a unit test that verifies the numerical values that the calculator program returns are correct.
Integration testing enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules. It is possible to automate integration testing.
System testing is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements. You can use automation tools for System Testing.
Acceptance testing involves testing the system’s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability. Depending on the system’s complexity, it can be done manually or through automation tools. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
In short, prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant. It’s like being a great chef for your robot, ensuring it has the perfect “ingredients” to serve you exactly what you need!

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"How do companies grow?"
‍"What strategies do tech startups use in their first year to increase customer base?"
Improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific than the vague prompt.
