# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enginnering involves using engineering tools and methods to create software system and programmes.
The importance of is in the creation of software programmes and models that is needed in the day to day running of the society in terms of allowing easy aceess to commerce, communication, transportation and majorly providing solutions to the major problems in different sectors in the country.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Product Design: This involve creating design of a particular product whether web page, e-commerce page that will display the product to be purchased by the customer in digital pages.
Product Development: This involve the creation of codes that runs through the display of the product on web pages for the customers. It could be in a mobile app,desktop website or android app.
Product Testing: These are process and standard that are put in place for the usage of the product to carry out its function and to satisfy the customer needs in ourchasing such product
Product deployment: This is the release of the mobile app to the customers at large.
Maintenance: This is the mechansim in ensuring adequate maintenance is done through updation go some of the back end and front end programme to ensure the smooth running of the system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Quality assurance 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
